            <p>Iron Man's premiere was a collaboration among editor and story-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber,
                story-artist Don Heck, and cover-artist and character-designer Jack Kirby. In 1963, Lee had been toying
                with the
                idea of a businessman superhero.</p>

            <p>He set out to make the new character a wealthy, glamorous ladies' man, but one with a secret that would
                plague and torment him as well.Writer Gerry Conway said, "Here you have this character, who on the
                outside is invulnerable, I mean, just can't be touched, but inside is a wounded figure. </p>

                <p>Well, he likely had a number of metals to choose from, or rather, a clever combination of a number of
                    metals. His options could include nickel-titanium (nitinol), which is an alloy of titanium. This
                    could be used due to it being a fairly strong metal that is relatively resistant to heat and
                    impressively light. Also, it is capable of ‘healing’, so to speak.</p>

                <p>The rules of time travel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe are mostly the same as in the comics: if
                    you go back in time, you are guaranteed to create a new, divergent timeline. As the Avengers
                    discussed in "Avengers: Endgame," it doesn't work like "Back to the Future," where if you change
                    something in the past, it can affect the future.</p>
